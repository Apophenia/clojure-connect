# Clojure-connect

Clojure-connect is a terminal-based version of four-in-a-row/Connect4 written in Clojure. It includes an AI player which uses a combination of static board evaluation and the minimax algorithm to make decisions.

Clojure-connect was the project where I took my first baby steps in Clojure, but I still enjoy revisiting it and would welcome forks, feedback, et cetera.
